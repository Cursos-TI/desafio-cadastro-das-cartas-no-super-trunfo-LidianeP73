This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to build and test a CMake project across multiple platforms (Windows and Linux) using different compilers (GCC, Clang, and MSVC). Here's a breakdown of its key components:

### Workflow Overview:
1. **Trigger Events**:
   - Runs on `push` and `pull_request` events targeting the `main` branch.

2. **Jobs**:
   - A single job named `build` is defined, which runs on a matrix of operating systems (`ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`) and compilers (`gcc`, `clang`, `cl`).

3. **Matrix Strategy**:
   - The `matrix` defines combinations of OS, build type, and compilers.
   - The `include` and `exclude` directives ensure the correct compiler is used for each OS (e.g., `cl` for Windows, `gcc` and `clang` for Linux).

4. **Steps**:
   - **Checkout**: Clones the repository using `actions/checkout@v4`.
   - **Set reusable strings**: Defines a reusable output directory for the build.
   - **Configure CMake**: Configures the CMake project with the appropriate compiler and build type.
   - **Build**: Builds the project using the configured CMake settings.
   - **Test**: Runs tests using `ctest` with the specified build configuration.

### Key Features:
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Linux and Windows.
- **Compiler Flexibility**: Supports GCC, Clang, and MSVC.
- **Reusable Outputs**: Uses step outputs to avoid hardcoding paths.
- **Fail-Fast Disabled**: Ensures all matrix combinations are executed, even if one fails.

### Example Matrix Combinations:
1. **Windows**:
   - OS: `windows-latest`
   - Compiler: `cl` (MSVC)
   - Build Type: `Release`

2. **Linux (GCC)**:
   - OS: `ubuntu-latest`
   - Compiler: `gcc`
   - Build Type: `Release`

3. **Linux (Clang)**:
   - OS: `ubuntu-latest`
   - Compiler: `clang`
   - Build Type: `Release`

### Customization:
- Add more build types (e.g., `Debug`, `RelWithDebInfo`) by expanding the `build_type` list in the matrix.
- Add more operating systems (e.g., `macos-latest`) by extending the `os` list.

This workflow is a robust starting point for CI/CD pipelines targeting multi-platform CMake projects.
